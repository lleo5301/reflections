When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working from different locations. When working with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  in order to make sure that the changes on the remote repository are correct.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  forks are clones in the github site that keep track of different things than clones
  clones are an identical copy of a branch either remote or local
  branches are simply the repository and its history.
  you would use clones when copying a repository from a remote or local repository
  you would use fork to copy a repository inside of github

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  in case the changes conflict.
