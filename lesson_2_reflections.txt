What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  This creates a new git repository. In order to start tracking file
  changes git needs to be initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  the staging area has not been committed therefore it does note actively affect
  the repository. it allows for changes before committing a file to a repository

How can you use the stagin are to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  once a file is added to a staging area you can simply call git status and it will
  display all the files waiting to be commited. Before committing the file you can
  check the differences from the repository by using git diff --staged
